# Project Description

## Players System

The Players System is a web-based application that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing player information. It is built using popular Java technologies such as Spring Core, Spring MVC, Hibernate, JSP, and MySQL DB.

The main goal of the Players System is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing player data, including their personal details, statistics, and performance records. The application allows users to perform the following operations:

1. *Create*: Users can add new player records to the system by providing relevant information such as name, age and number 

2. *Read*: Users can retrieve player information from the database and view it in a structured manner. The system provides search and filter functionalities to facilitate easy navigation and access to player records.

3. *Update*: Users can modify the existing player information, such as updating their personal details.

4. *Delete*: Users can remove player records from the system, effectively deleting them from the database.

The Players System leverages the power of Spring Core and Spring MVC frameworks for implementing the application's business logic and web layer. Hibernate, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, is used to manage the underlying database operations and provide a seamless integration between the application and the MySQL database.

The user interface is built using JSP (JavaServer Pages), which allows for dynamic content generation and easy integration with server-side Java code. JSP pages are responsible for rendering the views and interacting with the user through forms and input fields.

The MySQL database serves as the persistent storage for player data, ensuring data integrity and providing efficient retrieval and storage mechanisms.
